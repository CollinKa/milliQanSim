The PMT numbering has the following pattern:
 (9*6*4)*layerNumber+4*supermoduleNumber+barNumber
 The (9*6*4) is there to just give a bit offset between the layers. It's also the number of bars per layer in the full scale 18x12 bar detector we once studied, but now it just acts like a big offset between layers.
 The layer number is simple: Closest to the ground is 0, highest above the ground is 3
 Supermodule number: Here's the view of the numbering of the supermodules from the perspective of the interaction point and looking down the axis of the detector
 (to ceiling/surface)
 ___________
 |  3  |  1  |
 |  2  |  0  |
 -------------------
 (to floor/IP)
 Confusingly, the bar numbering doesn't work the same way. Within a supermodule, the bar numbers go like:
 ___________
 |  1  |  2  |
 |  3  |  4  |
 -------------------
 If we put these together, the numbering for bars within each layer works like this:
 4*supermoduleNumber + barNumber =
 (to ceiling/surface)
 _______________________
 |  13  |  14  |  5  |  6  |
 |  15  |  16  |  7  |  8  |
 |   9   |  10  |  1  |  2  |
 |  11  |  12  |  3  |  4  |
 ---------------------------------------
 (to floor/IP)
 So, layer 0 has these bar numbers. Layer 1 has these bar numbers but add (9*6*4)=216, layer 2 has these numbers but add 216*2, layer 3 add 216*3. All PMTs and bars should have these numbers as their label.
 There are also panels around the sides and on the front and back of the detector. The panels have these numbers:

 Top panel near ground: Slab number 73, PMT number 77
 Left panel near ground: Slab number 74, PMT number 78
 Right panel near ground: Slab number 75, PMT number 79
 Top panel near ceiling: Slab number 81, PMT number 81
 Left panel near ceiling: Slab number 82, PMT number 82
 Right panel near ceiling: Slab number 83, PMT number 83
 Small slab in front of detector near ground: Slab number 67, PMT numbers 97
 Small slab on back of detector near ceiling: Slab number 68, PMT numbers 96

(yes, I know the numbering looks super arbitrary, and it is... a few bookkeeping mistakes were made at times. But it has the advantage of working well once you use this mapping, so hopefully that's good enough)
