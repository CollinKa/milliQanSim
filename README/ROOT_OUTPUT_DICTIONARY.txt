Here is an overview of the parameters contained in the ROOT outputs from the sim.


The sample file here concerns mCPs, but for runs with muons the Gamma/Electron/Muon datastructures will populate with relevant data

=============================================================================================

TRACK LEVEL INFORMATION: (e.g. MuonTrack)

trackID: unique identifier (per-event) for a single track. Primaries are always 1 with parentID 0.

initial/finalProcessName: Generating process name (as a TString) for the particle

initial/finalVolumeName: Volume name at creation/destruction

initial/finalCopyNo: Initial and final copy number of the particle

initialTime/finalTime: Initial and final Geant4 event time of the creation/destruction of the track

initial/finalEnergy: Initial and final energy of the track in MeV

energyDeposit_MeV: Scored energy deposit of the track. Note that deposited energy in Geant has a very specific meaning that is not just "energy lost". To avoid EM divergence at low energies, would-be low-energy particles that would propagate for shorter than the default step length in the current material (0.7 mm by default) are just integrated over and the total energy is subtracted from the energy of the parent track. Deposited energy is used to accumulate these implicit energy deposits; to get total energy lost, add the deposited energy to the energy of any explicitly generated particles created by the parent.

parentID: Like trackID but for the parent particle

initial/finalPosition: Initial and final position of the track

totalTrackLength: Length between creation and destruction of the track. For particles that leave the sim boundaries without being absorbed somewhere, this ~20m long or more

Xposition/Yposition/Zposition: The entry position of muons into the milliQan cavern

Xf/Yf/Zfposition: The exit position of muons out of the milliQan cavern

nbOfElastics,nbOfInteractions: Currently unused interaction counting parameters

energyDiff: Differnce between the initial and final energy of the track (should double check that is how this is defined)

muonTrigUp/Low: Currently unused muon telescope triggering parameter

==============================================================================================
HIT LEVEL INFORMATION:

There are two types of "Hit" classes: PMTHit and ScintHit.

PMTHit populates when photons pass the quantum efficiency of a PMT (i.e. are detected by a PMT). This happens when a photon enters into the photocathode volume; its track is killed and then a detection check, given by the defined quantum efficiency, is made. Regardless of whether or not the detection passes, the track is always killed. Note that these checks are only made for photons; PMTHit is a photon detection hit class.

ScintHit populates when a user-specified particle (muon or mCP is the typical choice, depending on the type of primary being generated) enters and exits a scintillator volume. The class is populated with temp values when the particle enters a bar/panel/slab, and registers a hit when that same particle successfully makes it out of the scintillator. There is no detection efficiency involved; this is a kind of MCTruth parameter we use to track particle passage through the detector more explicitly

===========================================

PMT HIT INFORMATION:

pmtNumber: Copy number for each PMT. For bars, this will be the same number as the bar. For slabs (with 4 PMTs per slab), the numbering is different. See attached files for slab and bar numbering.

initialHitTime: Time of the hit in the PMT

trackID: Identifier for the track which generated the hit

parentID: Identifier for the parent of the track which generated the hit

============================================

SCINT HIT INFORMATION:

Whenever a particle enters or exists the scintillator, a hit will be generated containing that particle's energy (stored in EDep_MeV). Sum all the hits for each scintillator to get the scint's energy deposit for that event.

trackID: Track of particle which passed through the scint

parentID: Track ID for the parent of the track which generated the hit

EDep_MeV: Total energy loss (initial-final) of the particle from entry to exit

trackLength: Length of scintillator the track passed through from entry to exit

copyNo: Same as above. See attached files for slab and bar numbering.

hitTime: Initial time when the particle entered the scintillator

exitTime: Time when the particle exited the scintillator

particleName: Name of the particle (e+, neutron) that caused the hit

hitPosition, exitPosition: X,Y,Z of the entry and exit positions of the hit

=============================================================================================
EVENT LEVEL INFORMATION:

This information is populated once per event. So, if you run 1000 events, you'll get 1000 entries in all these parameters.

EventID: Event number (0,1,2,...,999)

NbGamma/Muon/Photon/Electron/etcTracks: For particles that are explicitly tracked, counts the number of those tracks for each event. Will be empty for both untracked particles (e.g. if you turn photons off) and for particles which never show up (e.g. if you do a muon run, the mCP counts will be zero)

NbPMT/ScintHits: Total number of times a hit was registered anywhere for a given event. For PMTs, the number of photons detected by all PMTs for an event. For Scint, the number of times the primary particle passed all the way through a bar/panel/slab

NbOfCerenkov/ScintillationPhotons: Number of photons generated by Cerenkov/Scintillation processes

absorptionCount and boundaryAbsorptionCount: Former populates when photons are absorbed (Process=="OpAbsorption"), latter populates when it does so at a material boundary (Process=="OpBoundary" && boundaryStatus == Absorbed)

pmtsAboveTrigger: Empty now, can be used if one wants to define a trigger threshold and process the triggers at runtime

Edep_MeV: a sum of all energy deposits (i.e. implicit energy loss, NOT explicit loss) by a given particle type (or all particles as it is now) over the course of the sim. Currently not being used usefully; just populating all energy deposits for all particle types right now

barHit/slabHit/panelHit: Number of times a primary of interest (the same one which populates ScintHit) enters a bar, slab, or panel, respectively. Currently unused, originally was used for demonstrator. Could activate again.

muonTrig: Not used now, but could be used as a trigger on e.g. geometric passage rather than some sort of PE cut if you want to design a trigger at runtime

eventWeight: Event Weight of the generator process (used when inputting fourvectors)

ProcessID: Type of generator process (used when inputting fourvectors)
